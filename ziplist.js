/*
Write a function called zipList that accepts two lists of equal length and returns the result of alternatingly taking elements. For example: given the two lists [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’] and [1, 2, 3], the function should return [‘a’, 1, ‘b’, 2, ‘c’, 3]. zipList should not use Underscore. Now write a function called zipListTheSimpleWay that does the same thing using Underscore.
